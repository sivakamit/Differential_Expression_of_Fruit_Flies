# Differential Expression of Fruit Flies

The main goal is to analyze the differentially expressed genes in female fruit flies and the link between those values and their eye sizes (small, medium, or big). Drosophila melanogaster is used as the model for development, mutation in drosophila embryos lead to drosophila embryogenesis and these embryos are developed in 2h intervals.
